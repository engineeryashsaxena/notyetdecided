Introduction
The client uses MS Excel, and maintains their product list, customer list, and prints the invoice, however it is not possible them to share the data from multiple system in multi user environment, there is lot of duplicate work, and chance of mistake. When the product price are changed they need to update each and every excel file. There is no option to find and print previous saved invoice. There is no security; any body can access any report and sensitive data, also no reports to find out the sales volume, stock list, and summary report. This eBilling and invoicing system is used to overcome the entire problem which they are facing currently, and making complete atomization of manual billing and invoicing system

Objective
This section presents a conceptual overview of the solution, and then provides an introduction to its requirements.
Solution Concept
The eBilling and Invoice System consists of:

* Customer, Products, Billing Generation: Automate the current manual bill generation system and maintain the searchable customer, products database and product invoice, maintain the data security, user rights.
* Report Generation: A Report Generation system will be developed for the user and management of eBilling and Invoicing System. This MIS system will have both details and summary type reports for analysis the sales volume, sales trend, available stock

Part of the solution will involve converting data from Microsoft Excel to the Database, system can import existing customer, product data from predefined MS Excel, CSV format. It reduces the data entry work and quick implementation of the system. 

The following diagram describes the proposed solution architecture at a high level.

User Profiles
The following user types are expected for the eBilling and Invoicing System:

UserBrief Description of Use ActionsSales RepresentativeDownloads and uploads customer and order information, which affects accounting, inventory and product data.  View customer and product data as described in metrics, track orders and deliveries.ManagerAll sales representative use actions, and management reports, quota establishment, reporting and adjustment.AccountantView and print stocks, track orders. Update product details like price.MIS ExecutiveGenerate reports, view and print inventory reports, view and print stock reports.
Usage Summary
eBilling and Invoicing System Version 1.0 will address the following use cases. The complete usage scenarios will be completed during the information-gathering process.  Use cases will be created and prioritized.  Selected use cases will be expanded into usage scenarios and features that are derived from both use cases and the usage scenarios, as represented in the following diagram:

Development Tools and Technologies

Front End

1. VB 6

Why VB6?

VB6 is built on the Windows Server System to take major advantage of the OS and which comes with a host of different servers which allows for building, deploying, managing and maintaining Windows Based solutions. The Windows Server System is designed with performance as priority and it provides scalability, reliability. 


The advantage of VB.NET includes
* Rapid Application Development (RAD) Support.
* Powerful Windows-based Applications 
* Simplified Deployment 
* Powerful, Flexible, Simplified Data Access 
* Improved Coding 
* Direct Access to the OS Platform 
* Object-Oriented Constructs 
* COM Interoperability


Back End
1. MS Access

Why MS Access?  
MS Access is desktop RDMS support small application with all features like relational query, different data types, joins, and query. Includes
* Easy to use and easy to deployment.
* Integration with Windows OS
* Scalability
* Import and Export of data in all major database system.
* Centralized Management
* Reliability
* Automating Tasks
